        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Seafood and pancakes on their own are great. They're my favorites. But the two of them in a single dish? Say no more! 
            Seafood pancake is a crispy, savory Korean-inspired dish filled with shrimp, squid (or any seafood of your choice), 
            and veggies in a light, golden batter. You can share it with your friends or your family, but honestly, 
            I'd rather devour the whole thing myself :).</p>
