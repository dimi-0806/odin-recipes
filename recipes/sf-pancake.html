        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Seafood and pancakes on their own are great. They're my favorites. But the two of them in a single dish? Say no more! 
            Seafood pancake is a crispy, savory Korean-inspired dish filled with shrimp, squid (or any seafood of your choice), 
            and veggies in a light, golden batter. You can share it with your friends or your family, but honestly, 
            I'd rather devour the whole thing myself :).</p>

        <p>For a step-by-step guide on how to clean and prepare the seafood, check out Maangchi's 
            <a href="https://youtu.be/Z8JLfr2s3DQ?si=NpLqE2KxwCHPySdu" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Seafood Pancake</a> video, 
            where she shows you exactly how it's done. This dish is also based on her recipe, so be sure to give it a watch.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>peeled and deveined shrimp, chopped</li>
            <li>cleaned squid, chopped</li>
            <li>2-3 green onions, chopped</li>
            <li>1 tbsp chopped carrots</li>
            <li>1 green chili pepper, chopped</li>
            <li>1/2 cup flour</li>
            <li>1/2 cup potato starch</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>1/2 cup water</li>
            <li>1 tbsp fish sauce</li>
            <li>1/4 tsp salt</li>

        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large bowl, mix all the ingredients except for the vegetable oil. Set aside.</li>
            <li>Heat a large frying pan over medium heat. Pour in about 2-3 tablespoons of vegetable oil in the pan and swirl it around to coat the pan evenly. </li>

            <li>Fry until the bottom of the pancake is crispy or light golden brown.</li>
            <li>Flip the pancake over. Add vegetable oil around the edges of the pancake and fry until the other side is crispy or light golden brown.</li>
            <li>Transfer the cooked pancake to a plate and serve with rice or as a snack.</li>
        </ol>
