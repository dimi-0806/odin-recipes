        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
            I love <em>sinigang</em>. It's my ultimate comfort food. From its preparation to finally eating it, every step brings me a sense of calm, 
            joy, and the feeling of home.

            <em>Sinigang</em> is a classic Filipino dish known for its signature sour flavor. It can be made using different souring agents like 
            tamarind, guava, kamias, or green mango. There are also packaged <em>sinigang</em> mixes that make cooking easier and more convenient. You can enjoy
            it with various proteins too, such as pork, fish, or shrimp.

            In this recipe, I am using pork spare ribs, but any cut of pork works just fine. For the souring agent, I use 
            a packet of <em>sinigang</em> mix because it's readily available in stores near me. But if you prefer using fresh ingredients,
            check out <em>Panlasang Pinoy</em>'s <a href="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Sinigang</em></a> recipe, which uses 
            fresh tamarind as the souring agent.
