            Mango float is one of my favorite desserts and my go-to recipe when we have mangoes at home. It is a no-bake Filipino icebox cake 
            made of layers of biscuit (traditionally, Graham crackers), whipped cream, and ripe mangoes. It is very easy to prepare and tastes
            absolutely delicious.

            Tip: Chill everything beforehand, especially the cream, condensed milk, mixing bowl, and the whisk attachments of your mixer. 
            This helps the cream mixture reach stable stiff peaks.

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>ripe mangoes</li>
            <li>Graham crackers (or any biscuit of your choice)</li>
            <li>heavy cream, chilled</li>
            <li>condensed milk, chilled</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Prepare a baking dish.</li>
            <li>Peel the mangoes and cut the cheeks off as close to the seed as possible.</li>
            <li>Cut the mango cheeks into thin slices. Set aside.</li>
            <li>In a chilled bowl, combine the cream and condensed milk. Whisk until stiff peaks form. 
                Use a stand mixer or hand mixer to make this step easier.</li>
            <li>Place a small amount of the whipped cream at the bottom of the baking dish and spread it evenly. 
                This will keep your biscuits from moving around during assembly.</li>
            <li>Add a single layer of Graham crackers.</li>
            <li>Top the Graham crackers with a layer of the cream mixture. Spread it evenly with an offset spatula or spoon.</li>
            <li>Add a layer of sliced mangoes.</li>
            <li>Repeat steps 6-8 to make another layer. Finish with a layer of the cream mixture.</li>
            <li>For the final layer, decorate the dessert as desired. You may add a layer of crushed grahams or arranged the mango slices decoratively.</li>
            <li>Cover the dish with cling wrap and place it in the fridge to chill overnight.</li>
            <li>Once chilled, cut the dessert into squares and serve.</li>
        </ol>
