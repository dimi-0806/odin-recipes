Odin Recipes is a website created as part of the requirements in the Foundations Course
of The Odin Project. It aims to demonstrate what I have learned so far from the course:
    -html elements, tags, and attributes
    -basic git commands (eg. git add, git commit, git push)
    -writing a commit message
